this is currently not in use but it will be fixed in the future once i can sync up the values between files



how it works:
the fonts are 8x10 technically but the extra 2 bits in 10 are for padding so for all purposes its 8x8
simply design the character and run the file.
to prevent a weird look make sure the top and bottom of characters match for the entire alphabet
for more detailed chars the 8x8 might be increased to 10x10 but probably not
